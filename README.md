# XPath Demo

This is just me trying out XPath. I'm using XPath to query XML data.

The library [xmlquery](https://github.com/antchfx/xmlquery) is being
used to help with the querying. This is just a simple CLI for using
querying feature locally instead of depending on an online tool so
as to be able to query with sensitive XML files / data
